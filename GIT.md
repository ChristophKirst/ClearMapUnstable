Plain user:

      `git pull`


Programmer: 

in case you want to update your code from the upstream repository

  * in terminal execute:
 
      `git fetch upstream`
      
      `git merge upstream/master`

  * if merging fails, some files will be highlighted with <<<<<< >>>>>> entries, fix this manually

  * if you dont care about your own changes and simply want the plain new version:

      `git reset --hard upstream/master`

  * to force it to your fork on github use
       
	  `git push origin/master --force`
